## Introduction
The goal of this project is to classify X-ray images into different categories using machine learning techniques. This can aid in the diagnosis of various conditions by providing automated analysis of medical images.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project consists of X-ray images sourced from publicly available medical image repositories. The images are preprocessed and labeled for training and evaluation.

## Installation
To get started with this project, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aryannnb1/X-Ray-Classification.git
cd X-Ray-Classification
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
### Training the Model
To train the model, run the following command:

```bash
python train.py
```

### Evaluating the Model
To evaluate the model, run:

```bash
python evaluate.py
```

### Predicting with the Model
To make predictions on new X-ray images, use:

```bash
python predict.py --image_path path_to_image
```

## Model
The model is built using deep learning techniques, leveraging convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to extract features from X-ray images. The architecture and training process are detailed in the Jupyter notebooks provided in this repository.

## Results
The model achieves high accuracy in classifying X-ray images. Detailed performance metrics and visualizations can be found in the results section of the repository.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! Please fork the repository and submit pull requests for any enhancements or bug fixes.

## License
This project is licensed under the MIT License. See the [LICENSE](LICENSE) file for more details.

## Future Work
We are developing an application to use this model practically. The application will use FastAPI for the backend to handle image uploads and predictions. The frontend will be built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to provide a user-friendly interface for uploading X-ray images and displaying results.
