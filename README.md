## Introduction
The goal of this project is to classify X-ray images into different categories using machine learning techniques. This can aid in the diagnosis of various conditions by providing automated analysis of medical images.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project consists of X-ray images sourced from publicly available medical image repositories. The images are preprocessed and labeled for training and evaluation.

## Installation
To get started with this project, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aryannnb1/X-Ray-Classification.git
cd X-Ray-Classification
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Future Work
Develop a webapp using FastAPI for the backend to handle image uploads and predictions and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to provide a user-friendly interface for uploading X-ray images and displaying results.
